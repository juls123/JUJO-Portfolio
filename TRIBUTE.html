			<p class="head">PERSONALITY</ul></p>
			<p class="p3"><i>Irene has shown to be very knowledgeable, showcasing herself as a historian when revisiting a folktale of her birthplace, seemingly enjoying the counterbalance of a "wonderful story" of the two angels of Zonia. She's shown to have a humorous side to her, as seen when she wanted to see Juliet and Heine do battle, only to later say it was a joke. In regards to her underlings, she is very attached to them, even referencing them as her "children," coming to their defense after their battle against Mirajane Strauss, painfully torturing the latter as collateral for defeating them.

				Irene is extremely confident in her own power, wanting to take care of Acnologia by herself (even talking of humanity's greatest threat without any timidity in her words) nevertheless as her very own comrades, among them being August, noted that they could not defeat the Black Dragon without Fairy Heart at their disposal. Due to this, her confidence not only spreads within her, but to the might of her Empire, saying that she could put aside the Majesty's "war game" due to the task of handling Acnologia, stating Alvarez (with her Majesty at the helm) would be victorious regardless of the outcome.</i></p>

			<p class="head">Skills</p>
			<ul class="skills">
				<li><span><i>Universe One (ユニバースワン Yunibāsu Wan): Also known as World Reconstruction Magic (世界再構築魔法 Sekai Sai Kōchiku Mahō), Irene, by firstly enchanting the land, can manipulate the very geography of the ground itself, with the ability of compressing the land to as much as five percent (or less) of its original size, thereby altering the entire landscape. The true purpose of this Magic is the power of bringing certain things or people to specific areas and locations, for example pushing the Emperor to the Fairy Tail Guild where Fairy Heart is located, while vanquishing Acnologia to deep into the sea. There are major side effects, as the new age Magic teleports all the inhabitants of the area (including Irene herself) and even structures and landmarks randomly all over the affected area. An indication to its power lies in the area of effect and Zeref's shock at the fact that Irene would cast it in the first place. Irene calls this Magic one of "a new era," indicating that it was created rather recently and would thus be unknown to someone who has knowledge of all Magics of old, such as Acnologia. She also noted that the casting she performed against Acnologia was her first ever time using Universe One.</span></i></li>
				<li><span><i>Eye Magic (眼の魔法 Me no Mahō): Irene has shown the ability to remotely view an area by summoning a giant eye in the sky over the location she wants to see and linking this eye with her true one. Both the giant eye and her real eye show a cross-shape pattern while the Magic is active.</i></span></li>
				<li><span><i>Sage Dragon Slayer Magic: Irene possesses Sage Dragon Slayer Magic, and was the one who created it for use in the Dragon King Festival. In her original body, it appears that Irene can only access her Sage Dragon Slayer Magic while in her Dragon form, with the most notable benefit is that it allows her to magnify the power of her enchantments. Her four hundred years of experience in said Magic allowed her to effortlessly, and almost masterfully, make use of Wendy's Sky Dragon Slayer Magic the very first time she tried using it. (Unnamed)

					Sage Dragon's Roar: Being a Dragon, so long as she has assumed this shape, Irene can spout destructive blasts from her mouth like the rest of the race, which can easily decimate an entire castle. (Unnamed)</span></i></li>
				<li><span><i>Enchantment (付加術 Fukajutsu): Irene has shown extremely high proficiency in the art of enchantment; so much that she's classified as a High Enchanter (高位付加術士ハイエンチャンター Hai Enchantā), evidenced by her ability to change and alter landscapes, climates, and the terra firma of the world, as well as manipulate the atmosphere, objects, people, even able to turn inanimate objects into fully functioning people or humans into animals. It's been noted by Zeref that she's prodigious when it comes to attaching and detaching Magic from objects, as seen when she offers to detach Fairy Heart from Mavis, something which should normally be impossible. However, due to Fairy Heart's complex nature, this task proves time-consuming and delicate for even Irene.</i></span></li>

			<p class="p3" style="font-size: 14px;"><i>Irene is a tall, voluptuous woman with thickly braided, bow-adorned, scarlet hair. Her two front braids have two golden ornaments near the upper sections; she also wears two U-shaped earrings (one on each ear), and wears red lipstick.

				For clothing, Irene dons a risqué version of the typical witch's garb. Her black top has a diamond-shaped opening, exposing a portion of her breasts, and a heart-shaped pattern around the borders. It extends down to the naval of her stomach where it meets a large angular scar, is draped over by a dark-colored cape with a light-colored inside and two medallion gold-like ornaments, and is held together by a golden chain. Not left bare, too, her neck is decorated by other small cloth-based accessories, including a wide bow. Additionally, Irene wears an elongated black loincloth with the symbol of the Alvarez Empire emblazoned on its front, having white borders on its edges and being connected to another cloth piece with the very same heart-shaped design. She also wears black thigh-high boots with heels that have a white-colored border near the top and gloves of the same color and design, only having claw-like extensions. Her black witch's hat is much larger than her head and possesses dreadlock designs with white bandaging near its ends. It also has a fur lining near its edges.
				
				As a Dragon, Irene is many times larger than the average human, with light-colored scales running all over her body. She has a dark-colored fiery-man running down her back and arms, which appear to be connected to her feathery wings. While having three pairs of extensions from her jaw, Irene has a dark-colored wing-like design over her eyes that's complemented by two oval designs right above it, the bigger one on the bottom and the smaller one on top. She also has them on her paws, four extending from the forearm and three on each finger. There's a noticeable border abover her nostrils that divides her mouth from her face, extending near the back of her head. Finally, Irene has a pair of jagged horns extending from the base of her skull and feather-like scales extending from the back of her knees.<br/>

			<p class="head">TRIVIA</p>

			<p>In Volume 57, Hiro Mashima showcased the various early design concepts for Irene.
				In the the top-left design, Irene sports a two-brace neck ware to go along with her slicked back hair and her visible forehead.
				In the top-middle design, the mark of the Alvarez Empire is shown to be on her back.
				In the top-right design, her face is drawn with wrinkles and appears to be older than her current.
				In the mid-left design, her appearance is similar to her current, but with shorter hair while a different design of her gloves is shown.
				In the mid-region, her hair is in a ponytail with a decorate bandanna tied around it.
				In the mid-right design, her appearance resembles Erza Knightwalker, with a long bang reaching from the right side of her face to go along with a primitive outfit.
				Her bottom-left design sports a clear bandanna and an eye patch.
				Her bottom-middle design is a light-colored sketch of her side view.
				Her bottom-right design is her current design, with her from two long locks tied in medallion ornaments, completing it with a witch garb-like hat.
				Irene being the "mother" of Dragon Slayers and the creator of Dragon Slayer Magic was decided before she ever appeared in the manga. However, Hiro admitted that her relationship with Erza was not decided on until after her encounter with Acnologia in Chapter 488, which caused the conversation about Dragon Slayer Magic between the two to be omitted.</p>

			<p class="head">HISTORY</p>
			<p class="p-4" >Colloquially known as the Queen of Dragons, Irene lived four hundred years ago, having married Rung (a general of a neighboring country) for political settlement of territorial disputes and became pregnant with his child. Due to her incredible Magic Power, she was the queen of a country called Dragnof, which was one of several in Ishgar that had Dragons and humans peacefully coexisting. One day, while in the courtyard of her castle, Irene was visited by her friend, the Sage Dragon Belserion, who had returned from reconnaissance of the Dragons on the western continent. Irene learned from Belserion that the western Dragons attack and eat humans, and that they will inevitably invade Ishgar, an idea that Irene found unthinkable. She and Belserion agreed that humans and Dragons have shown to be able to positively live together, and wondered if the bonds humans and Dragons built would be shattered by the invasion. Belserion, however, reassured her that he would not allow that to happen, and that he would protect the humans.

				Some time later, with the war underway, Irene demonstrated her ability to use magical enchantments in front of a crowd of her subjects, instilling them with the hope that she could empower the Dragons. After much fighting, the pro-coexistence side of the war began to lose due to betrayal from some of Ishgar's Dragons, who felt that humans were beneath them, and the overwhelming number of enemies they faced. After one of many battles, Belserion told Irene that they were going to lose, but reiterated his desire to protect humans. Irene wondered why Belserion would go so far; he reminded her of the debt he owes her family because of her predecessor saving his life, which she states he had repaid long ago. Hearing Belserion's unshakable resolve, Irene resolved to enter the war, and wondered aloud as to whether Belserion could enchant his Magic onto her and turn her into a person with the power to slay a Dragon: a Dragon Slayer. While Irene's plan was largely successful, humans could not contain the power of a Dragon, and they either became consumed by their overwhelming power, or developed motion sickness because of the conflict between their draconian senses and physical bodily composition. Regardless, she fought alongside Belserion and her husband, who accompanied her during every battle, and was present when Acnologia killed him and ended the war. One week after the end of the war, Irene, planted with a Dragon Seed like all other Dragon Slayers, began to turn into a Dragon. Confronted by her husband, who called her a monster, he ordered her to be put in the dungeons, fearing that she would become like Acnologia. She tried to deter him by revealing that she was pregnant with his child, but the man claimed her to be a liar. From then on, for three years, Irene was tortured, humiliated and beaten, all while keeping her child's growth halted with Magic. Irene, now largely covered in scales, was visited by her husband, who told her that she had an execution date scheduled. She tried telling him about their child yet again, but still believing it to be a lie, he attacked her, slashing her stomach in an attempt to cut the baby out. This triggered Irene's complete transformation into a Dragon, wherein she rampaged and killed her husband before flying away, claiming that she was human and wanted anyone to help her get her old body back. Several hundred years passed, with Irene remaining a Dragon until Zeref happened upon her hiding place in the mountains and, realizing she was human, enchanted her back into her human appearance within moments. Elated that she had regained her form, Irene initially expressed her lack of care at the fact that she was still physiologically a Dragon, but was eventually struck with insanity when the physical sensations and consequences of being a Dragon carried over. Sad, Irene stated that she only wanted to give birth to her child as a human, but soon became deluded with the idea that if she could enchant herself unto her unborn child and give birth, she would have a human body again. Irene tried and failed, and thus discarded her in the back alleys of Rosemary Village, lacking any more use for her.

However, these events were later stated by Irene to have been fabricated. In truth, Irene could not muster the willpower to enchant herself into her newborn daughter and instead chose to leave Erza at a church in Rosemary Village out of fear that one day, that feeling would fade and she would try to enchant herself into her regardless.

Following this event, Irene crossed over to Alakitasia to join the Alvarez Empire and serve under Zeref. While there, Irene used her mastery over Enchantment to transfix personalities unto a black sword and a white sword, which became her two personal attendants and members of the Irene Squad: Heine and Juliet, respectively.</p>
